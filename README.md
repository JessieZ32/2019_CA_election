# 2019_CA_election
If "everyone" had voted in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election......

I used two sets of data, one is 2019 CES online survey data, which is obtained by loading cesR package; the other is 2016 Canadian census data: individuals file (Publice-Use Microdata File), which is obtained from the CHASS data centre. For the latter one, I stored the dataset in folder Inputs/data_raw.

The scripts for data cleaning is stored in the folder Scripts. And during the cleaning, I stored some data subsets in the folder Inputs/data_in_process. And I stored the final version of cleaned datasets in folder Inputs/data_cleaned.

The paper is stored in folder Outputs/Paper. The references file is also stored in this folder.

Note: 
     There is only the rmd file of paper, because knitting to pdf, html or word format is not working due to unknown reasons.
